## React app for listing users

Clone the repo
- `git clone ...`

Note: Make sure node, npm and mongoDB are installed.

install node modules
- `npm install`

run the app
- `npm start`

I have used `settimeout()` before a server call is made,  to give the user a better experience. In production it might be removed.
